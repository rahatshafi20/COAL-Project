# COAL-Project
This is my Assembly Language project built using MASM x86 and Irvine library.
You will have to configure and setup irvine library and MASM x86 on VS Studio to run this
This project has almost all features implemented except some add-ons and that it is unable
to read content from file, otherwise it writes to file and all other featurees are completed.
